			<h2>Abstract</h2>

					Learning visual features from unlabeled image data is an important yet challenging task, 
					which is often achieved by training a model on some annotation-free information. We consider 
					spatial contexts, for which we solve so-called jigsaw puzzles, i.e., each image is cut into 
					grids and then disordered, and the goal is to recover the correct configuration. Existing 
					approaches formulated it as a classification task by defining a fixed mapping from a small 
					subset of configurations to a class set, but these approaches ignore the underlying relationship 
					between different configurations and also limit their application to more complex scenarios.
					<br><br>This paper presents a novel approach which applies to jigsaw puzzles with an arbitrary grid 
					size and dimensionality. We provide a fundamental and generalized principle, that weaker cues 
					are easier to be learned in an unsupervised manner and also transfer better. In the context 
					of puzzle recognition, we use an iterative manner which, instead of solving the puzzle all at 
					once, adjusts the order of the patches in each step until convergence. In each step, we combine 
					both unary and binary features on each patch into a cost function judging the correctness of the 
					current configuration. Our approach, by taking similarity between puzzles into consideration, 
					enjoys a more reasonable way of learning visual knowledge. We verify the effectiveness of our 
					approach in two aspects. First, it is able to solve arbitrarily complex puzzles, including 
					high-dimensional puzzles, that prior methods are difficult to handle. Second, it serves as 
					a reliable way of network initialization, which leads to better transfer performance in a few 
					visual recognition tasks including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.</p>

						different knowledge sources, network backbones and training strategies.
