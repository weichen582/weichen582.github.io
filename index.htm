                    Focused on solving the <b>inverse problem of image restoration.</b> <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp Proposed a deep network for <b>low-light enhancement</b>. As an effective tool for low-light enhancement, Retinex
                    model assumes that images can be decomposed into reflectance and illumination. Without any ground-truth, our Retinex-Net
                    can learn to decompose a natural image with only key constraints including the consistent reflectance shared by paired
                    low/normal-light images, and the smoothness of illumination. The decomposition results are better than previous
                    hand-crafted models, which lead to better low-light enhancement results. We built a low-light image dataset, which
                    consists of paired low-light and normal-light images captured in real scenes for network training. <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp In September 2018, I provided an oral presentation on <i>BMVC 2018</i> for our paper "<i>Deep Retinex Decomposition
                    for Low-Light Enhancement</i>".

                        Focused on visual representation learning in an <b>self-supervised manner</b>. <br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp We are trying to achieve this goal by enforcing neural networks to learn from spatial contexts. 
                        Without heavy burden of human annotation, each training image is turned into a jigsaw puzzle, 
                        in which the image is cut into pieces and the pieces are disordered spatially. The network must 
                        resume these pieces into the correct configuration. After training such a model <b>solving jigsaw puzzles</b>, 
                        we can transfer the learned features into other general visual recognition tasks, such as classification,
                        detection and segmentation, by initialization. In our experiments, the networks initialized by jigsaw puzzle
                        models for visual recognition tasks can enjoy a major benefit, comparing with training from scratch. We are also
                         trying to provide performance boost for medical image analysis by using such a self-supervised method.<br>
                         &nbsp &nbsp The project is still continuing.

                    Google online tool that analyzes web sites and rates their performance. I implemented <b>a development tool 
                    in C++</b> for PSI, which gathers the scores for a large sample URL set rated by two versions of PSI, so as
                    to evaluate the optimized rating system for its rationality, validity and stability. <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp The tool is designed in a parallel, distributed manner as a Map/Reduce job, so as to exploit the massive 
                    computing groups of Google, which can reduce the runtime from dozens of days in a sequential manner to around 
                    four hours in a parallel manner. I also designed a web page which can provide more friendly user interface,
                    automatically save evaluation results, and query evaluation history.
