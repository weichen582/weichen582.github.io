    	<h1>HELLO</h1>
        <p> Hi, I am Chen Wei, and currently a final-year undergraduate student majoring in 
            <b>Computer Science</b> at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at 
            Peking University, Beijing, P.R.China. I worked with Prof. 
            <a href="http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/people/liujiaying.html">Jiaying Liu</a> and 
            <a href="http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/">STRUCT Team</a>. In 2018, I had
            this amazing summer in Baltimore, MD, working with
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Distinguished_Professorships">Bloomberg Distinguished Professor</a>
              <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/index.html">Alan Yuille</a>
            and <a href="http://ccvl.jhu.edu/publication/">CCVL Lab</a> at Johns Hopkins University.
             I also spent time at Google.

        <p> My research interets lie primarily in the area of Computer Vision, specifically, visual representation learning and 
            solving the inverse problem of the image restoration. Here is my <a href="./files/CV_WeiChen.pdf">CV</a> and

                    Continuing my research on unsupervised / self-supervised learning. With the rapid
                    growth of the scale of visual data resources, and thus the onerous burden of human
                    annotation, I believe research on learning with limited supervision would be especially
                    valuable in the future.

                    &nbsp &nbsp Proposed a deep network for <b>low-light enhancement</b>. As an effective tool for low-light enhancement, Retinex
                    model assumes that images can be decomposed into reflectance and illumination. Without any ground-truth, our Retinex-Net
                    can learn to decompose a natural image with only key constraints including the consistent reflectance shared by paired
                    low/normal-light images, and the smoothness of illumination. The decomposition results are better than previous
                    hand-crafted models, which lead to better low-light enhancement results. We built a low-light image dataset, which
                    consists of paired low-light and normal-light images captured in real scenes for network training. <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp In September 2018, I provided an oral presentation on <i>BMVC 2018</i> for our paper "<i>Deep Retinex Decomposition
                    for Low-Light Enhancement</i>".

                        Focused on visual representation learning in an <b>self-supervised manner</b>. <br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp Focused on visual representation learning in a self-supervised manner. We achieve this goal by enforcing neural
                        networks to learn from spatial contexts. Without the heavy burden of human annotation, each training image
                        is turned into a jigsaw puzzle, in which the image is cut into pieces, and the pieces are disordered spatially. The
                        network must resume these pieces into the correct confguration. After training such a model solving jigsaw
                        puzzles, we can transfer the learned features into other general visual recognition tasks, such as classifcation,
                        detection, and segmentation, by initialization. We also provide a performance boost for medical image analysis
                        by such a self-supervised method. <br>
                         &nbsp &nbsp A paper about this project is currently under review..
